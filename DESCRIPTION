Description: Tissues are a complex milieu consisting of numerous cell types. 
    In cancer, understanding the cellular heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment is
    an emerging field of research. Numerous methods have been published in recent years
    for the enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles. However, the 
    available methods suffer from three major problems: inferring cell subset based on
    gene sets learned and verified from limited sources; displaying only partial portrayal 
    of the full cellular heterogeneity; and insufficient validation in mixed tissues.
    The xCell package performs cell type enrichment analysis from gene expression data for 
    64 immune and stroma cell types. xCell is a gene signatures-based method learned from
    thousands of pure cell types from various sources. xCell applies a novel technique for
    reducing associations between closley related cell types. xCell signatures were 
    validated using extensive in-silico simulations and also cytometry immunophenotyping, 
    and were shown to outperform previous methods. xCell allows researchers to reliably 
    portray the cellular heterogeneity landscape of tissue expression profiles.
